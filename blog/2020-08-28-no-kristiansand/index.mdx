# Journey to Kristiansand

<ImageText image="kristiansand/schiff.jpg">
Every journey begins with the first step: First we drove to Hirtshals on the Danish North Sea coast to travel from there overnight by ship to Stavanger. Originally, a trip with a speedboat directly to Kristiansand was planned, but unfortunately this was cancelled at short notice by the shipping company. However, a night trip on a large car ferry is a very rewarding experience!

# From Stavanger to Kristiansand

Our stops along the way: Various places along the coast at the southernmost point of Norway: Lindesnes Fyr Lighthouse. A drive along the coastal road has its own special charm and every bend holds a new spectacular view.

# Discovery of Kristiansand and it's surroundings

<ImageSliderText parentDirectory={"img_kristiansand"} >
During our stay near Kristiansand, we had a pretty little house overlooking a small bay and lighthouse on the island of Flekkeroy. An exploration of this island on the first day was followed by a trip to downtown Kristiansand, which is about 25 minutes away by car. A special highlight here is the theater, which is located directly on the water and catches the eye with its impressive architecture. Furthermore, there is a beautiful waterfront promenade that leads directly past the fish market, where a wide selection of fish specialties are offered. Also worth mentioning is the good location directly on an extensive recreation area, which invites you to go hiking and cross-country skiing in winter. All in all, we enjoyed our time in and around Kristiansand very much and found a nice start to our Norway trip.
