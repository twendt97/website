# Hiking tour to the Preikestolen

The hike to the Preikestolen starts about 400 meters below the destination at the parking lot, which, due to the extraordinary fame of this rock, costs 250 Norwegian crowns. In return, you get a very well-maintained path to the rock and lots of company. The otherwise lonely land suddenly seems like a gathering place of different nations, because everyone who comes to this region of Norway wants to catch a glimpse of the rock and, of course, of the Lysefjord 600 meters below. The climb itself is easily done in about two hours and those who still have time and desire should also make a detour to the far less crowded adjacent peaks. A visit here is definitely worthwhile, but it does not reflect the otherwise lonely nature of Norway.

# Hiking tour the Reinaknuten

Not far from our accommodation in JÃ¸rpeland we started the climb up to one of the highest mountains in the area, the Reinaknuten. Despite the low absolute altitude of just 787 meters above sea level, there is an alpine feeling on the way. Already at about 500 meters above sea level you reach the tree line and after that you feel like in the high mountains: rocks and heather as far as the eye can see. At the top you will be rewarded by a magnificent view of the Tysdalsvatnet, which is a lake in the adjacent valley, and imposing steep rock faces. This first major hiking tour in Norway motivated us for further adventures!
