summary: Even though Bergen is the second largest city in Norway, one cannot speak of a big city atmosphere when exploring the narrow streets and admiring the colorful wooden houses at the harbor.

# Bergen City Center

Norway's second largest city has a population of just under 280,000, and it shows. There is no sign of the hustle and bustle of the big city, and you don't have to rely on any means of transportation in the city center. It can be crossed on foot in less than an hour. The most charming thing about Bergen is the selection of local stores. Instead of the usual fashion chains you can see the typical Norwegian woolen sweaters in the shop windows and in the old storehouses in Bryggen you can nowadays taste delicacies and buy all kinds of souvenirs. Even the usually bad weather can be well endured during a visit to a cozy of the cafes.

# Bergen's surroundings

During our stay in Bergen we had a nice house about half an hour outside the city center. So we were already in the quiet surroundings of Bergen and used the location as a starting point towards the city and even further into nature. Bergen itself holds several possibilities for hikers. These include, for example, the Lyderhorn as well as the Floyen. The summit of the Floyen can be used as a good starting point for the approximately three-hour hike on the Blamanen and on the adjacent Rundemanen. We were lucky with the weather and could enjoy the view. North of Bergen there are some sparsely populated islands, which are suitable for relaxed walks on flat terrain. Windsurfing and sailing is also possible, of course! Overall, Bergen offers a good mix of city and nature. In a few minutes you can also walk into the nature if not in solitude.
