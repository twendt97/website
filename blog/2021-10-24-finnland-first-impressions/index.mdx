summary: I did the journey to Tampere by car and fortunately my friend Jessica decided to join the ride since she needed to go to Stockholm. We stayed two nights in Copenhagen before heading to Stockholm where I finally took the ferry to Turku in Finland.

# Journey via Copenhagen

<ImageSliderText parentDirectory="img_copenhagen">
On our way to Stockholm and finally Tampere we made use of the opportunity to stop by in Copenhagen. We rented an Airbnb for the night and our hosts were so kind to invite us to the Irish Pup on the same evening we arrived. After enjoying a couple of the expensive danish beers we quickly made new friends who introduced us to the nightlife of Copenhagen. Destroyed but with rich experience from the party night we managed to get out of bed on the next day and to take a look around the city which is really enjoyable by the way. All in all, our stay in Copenhagen was a full success and a perfect kickstart to the upcoming adventures.

# Arrival in Tampere

<ImageSliderText parentDirectory="img_tampere">
After dropping of Jessica in Stockholm, I continued my journey to Finland by ferry. On 24th of August I finally arrived in Tampere where I experienced a warm welcome. I got the chance to participate on the Tampere Marathon and I discovered the beautiful landscapes in the region. I have the impression that camp fire and grilling something tasty on it is a huge part of the finish culture and therefore you will find camp fire places with perfect fire wood anywhere in the country. Overall, my arrival in Finland was successful and I experienced nothing but friendliness.
